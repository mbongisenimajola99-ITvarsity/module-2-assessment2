                      <h3>THE HISTORY OF COFFEE</h3>
                   
             <p> Circa A.D. 800-900
The discovery of coffee berries (cherries) was made by an Ethiopian goat farmer named Kaldi. Legend has it that Kaldi
became intrigued after he observed his goats becoming quite energetic and dancing around after eating the red fruit
of the coffee shrub. He decided to try one of these magical berries and found that they made him more lively and
active as well!
Fortunately for us, a clever monk came across Kaldi and his dancing goats. This monk picked some berries and
crushed them into a powder. He placed the powder into boiling water and made the first cup of coffee. He then
realized after tasting this crazy concoction that it released energy. Ecstatic with his findings he rushed back to his
monastery to enlighten his fellow monks. The monks hailed this discovery as a “gift from the Lord”, as they could now
pray long into the night.
Before it became our beverage of choice, coffee had a variety of preparations. Keep in mind that coffee is a cherry-like
fruit that has a bean at the center of the red coffee fruit. At one point, the fermented pulp of the fruit was used to
make a wine-like concoction. It was also mixed with animal fat to make a protein-rich snack bar.
Circa A.D. 1000
Arabian traders brought this special plant across the Red Sea into Yemen (Arabia). This is where the idea of roasting
coffee was conceived. They cultivated coffee on plantations, roasted them, and boiled the beans to create a drink they
called “qahwa” (literally meaning “that which prevents sleep”). The term “qahwa” is synonymous with a romantic term
for “wine and drinks dark in color.” Coffee has roots in several languages; it later became the Turkish "kahveh," then
Dutch "koffie" and finally "coffee" in English.</p>
